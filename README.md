# Open in Cursor - Right Click Menu for Windows

This repository shows how to add a **"Open in Cursor"** option to the right-click context menu in Windows File Explorer. It allows you to launch the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/) AI code editor directly in any folder with a single click.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What It Does

- Adds **"Open in Cursor"** when you right-click on a folder or empty space inside a folder.
- Opens that location directly in the Cursor editor (like `cursor .`).
- Uses either a `.reg` file or a PowerShell script to set up the registry keys.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### Method 1: PowerShell Script

> Make sure the `cursor` CLI works in your terminal before running this.

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.
2. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   .\add_cursor_context.ps1

### Method 2: Manual Reg File

1. Open add_cursor_context.reg in Notepad.
2. Replace YourUserName with your actual Windows username.
3. Double-click the file to merge it into the Registry.
4. Restart File Explorer (or log out/in) to apply.
